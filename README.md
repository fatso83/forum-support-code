# Forum support code

Forum, issue tracker and StackOverflow questions often come with incomplete or buggy code, which might require recreating a functional version to verify the problem at hand. Instead of creating a new repo for each question (which I have do so far), this repo can hold all support code, where each issue/question can live in its own subdirectory.
